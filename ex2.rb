# Using a comment; this is so you can read your program later.
# Anything after the # is ignored by Ruby.

puts "I could have code like this." # and the comment after is ignored.

# You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out a piece of code:

puts "This is a practice excercise;"
print "this will run."

# puts "This will not run."

print "This was completed by: " 
puts "Gina M Bello"

# I learned that "puts" prints on a new line. And "print" prints. 

# touch updates the time it was updated- date modified, and if there is no file then it makes a blank new one with the indicated name that you put
