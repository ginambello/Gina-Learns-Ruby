puts "I could have code like this." # and the comment after is ignored.

# You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out a piece of code:

puts "This is a practice excercise;"
print "this will run."

# puts "This will not run."

print "This was completed by: " 
puts "Gina M Bello"

# I learned that "puts" prints on a new line, and "print" prints. 

# touch updates the time it was updated- date modified, and if there is no file then it makes a blank new one with the indicated name that you put

# git status tells you what you are doing
# git log gives you log what you have committed
# git add adds your file to the index

# There's this thing called working file- the directory on your computer.
# touch ex3.rb adds ex3.rb if there was no ex3.rb before
# git add, adds it to Index
# Index is the queue to add to github
# You have History and that has the history of all the commits in order
# To get index stuff to history you do: git commit
# That moves it from Index into History

# Do ls -al to see history 
# You'll see there is .git, this is a hidden file
# On github website all you have is another copy of the history
# My computer to github requires a push
# If you use more than one computer github can get ahead of you
# Let's say you were on another computer working on same doc, use git pull to go top-down
# Only push to your own stuff
# Fork it to get a copy of their stuff

# Control c stops the thing you typed, it aborts
