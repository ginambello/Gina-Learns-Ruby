puts "I could have code like this." # and the comment after is ignored.

# You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out a piece of code:

puts "This is a practice excercise;"
print "this will run."

# puts "This will not run."

print "This was completed by: " 
puts "Gina M Bello"

# I learned that "puts" prints on a new line. And "print" prints. 

# touch updates the time it was updated- date modified, and if there is no file then it makes a blank new one with the indicated name that you put

# git status tells you what you are doing
# git log gives you log what you have committed
# git add adds your file to

# there's this thing called working file, the directory on your computer
# touch ex3.rb adds ex3.rb
# git add, adds to Index, is the cue to add to github
# you have History and has history of all the commits in order
# to get index stuff to history you do git commit
# that moves it from index into history
# working copy is physical copy
# index is a cue
# history is still on my computer
# do ls -al to see history there is .git, this is a hidden file
# on github all you have is another copy of the history
# my computer to github requires a push
# if you use more than one computer, Github can get ahead of you
# let's say you were on another computer working on same doc, use gitpull
# only push to your own stuff
# fork it to get a copy of their stuff

# control c stops the thing you typed, it aborts
